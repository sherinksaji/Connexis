# How might we utilise technology to mitigate risks of being burnt out and help lawyers with their mental health when it comes to hybrid working arrangements?

Hybrid work is here to stay in a post-pandemic world. While hybrid work offers greater flexibility, it disrupts predictable day-to-day routines and causes decision fatigue, something which legal professionals are no strangers to. To help them cope with the resultant stress and anxiety, we have developed a solution aimed at promoting the habits of mindfulness, visualisation, and self-affirmation.

ZenNote is a note-taking mobile application with the unique functionality of sending notes to your future self. Doubling up as a reminder system, users can send short, encouraging notes to themselves on a scheduled future date, be it a big client meeting or a tide-turning trial. Users can also choose emojis that represent their moods at the point of writing to be displayed alongside the note. We developed the application with Android Studio and Java, using MongoDB Realm for database management.

A study by Michigan State University shows that expressive writing helps us perform upcoming stressful tasks more efficiently. When writing notes to our future selves, we have a rare opportunity to introspect and think about who we want to become. Jeena Cho, author of The Anxious Lawyer, suggests that legal professionals who practise mindfulness and visualisation become more optimistic. Given the legal professionals' long and often irregular working hours, writing notes is the most realistic way to practise mindfulness.

When reading notes, legal professionals receive affirmation from the most valuable source — themselves. Existing lifestyle apps that provide encouragement sound more intimidating than inspiring — the Apple Watch authoritatively tells you to “close your rings” — whereas writing your personal affirmations ensures that what you read puts a smile on your face because you know yourself best. Complete with a suite of educational materials such as breathing exercises and guided meditations, ZenNote is positioned to help legal professionals live their best lives.

For the purposes of the demo, we set the notification delay to 1 minute. It will open up the note for the current date, instead of the date that we set. In reality, the delay is set to show the notification on the date of sending. Then, when we tap on the notification, the note for the date of sending is shown.
